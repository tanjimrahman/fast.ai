fast.ai Course work
This course spans 7 weeks and focuses on deep learning neural networks. It follows a practical top down approach for programmers with 1 year experience.

Course Outline
YOU WILL LEARN HOW TO:
Set up your own GPU server in the cloud
Use the fastai and Pytorch libraries in python to train and run deep learning models
Build, debug, and visualize a state of the art convolutional neural network (CNN) for recognizing images
Build state of the art recommendation systems using neural-network based collaborative filtering
Build state of the art time series and structured data models using categorical embeddings
Get great results even from small datasets, by using transfer learning
Understand the components of a neural network, including activation functions, dense and convolutional layers, and optimizers
Build, debug, and visualize a recurrent neural network (RNN) for natural language processing (NLP), including developing a sentiment classifier which beat all previous academic benchmarks.
Recognize and deal with over-fitting, by using data augmentation, dropout, batch normalization, and similar techniques
